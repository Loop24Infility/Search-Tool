# Search Tool README

Welcome! This tool is a simple Python script that lets you search for terms on popular educational websites like Reddit, GeeksforGeeks, Quora, and Wikipedia right from your command line.

## How to Set Up and Run

1. **Download Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for Windows.

2. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the Python code as `search_tool.py` in a folder you can easily access (e.g., your Documents folder).

3. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, or searching for PowerShell in the Start menu.

4. **Navigate to the Script's Folder**:
   - Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you saved `search_tool.py`. For example, if you saved it in Documents, type:
     ```shell
     cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Type the following command to start the tool:
     ```shell
     python search_tool.py
     ```
   - If you see an error, make sure you’re in the same directory as the script or use the full path (e.g., `python C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\search_tool.py`).

## How to Use the Tool

1. **Start a Search**:
   - Once the program is running, you’ll see a prompt `>>`. To search, type `s` followed by your search query. For example:
     ```
     s semiconductor physics
     ```

2. **Results**:
   - The program will open your default web browser and display Google search results filtered to show only the selected educational websites.

3. **Exit**:
   - Type `exit` or `quit` to stop the tool and close the program.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found**: Make sure you’re in the correct directory or use the full path to `search_tool.py`.
- **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.

And that’s it! Now you’re all set to use this simple search tool to get fast, focused results on educational sites right from your terminal. Enjoy!
